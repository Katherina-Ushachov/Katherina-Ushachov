- 👋 Hi, I’m @Katherina-Ushachov
- 👀 I’m interested in making electronic music using voicebanks, the inner workings of the universe, progressive sff literature in German, and actually lots of other stuff that would probably break the containment of this README.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code, that's why I'm here. I'm also learning how to use SynthV software, Clip Studio Paint, Sonus music software and DaVinci videomaking. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on amazing stuff. I haven't thought that through, yet.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can text me over at @evanesca@literatur.social.
- 😄 Pronouns: she / her.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I told an aquaintance that I'm starting to learn coding he misheard and asked me where that language is spoken. To which I replied, slightly puzzled, "at your computer". We cleared up the misunderstanding and it was a nice laugh.

Languages:
- some Java
- some SQL
- Lots of HTML and CSS
- some Javascript
